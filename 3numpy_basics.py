# Before starting, create the 3D array td that is supposed to be a stack of 50
# (mono) images of size 5Ã—5. An image at index i should have entries i everywhere.
# Give code snippets for the following operations:

import numpy as np
import sys

td = np.stack([np.full((5, 5), i) for i in range(50)])
# print("shape", td)

# ----------Similar to 
# td = []
# for i in range(50):
#     td.append(np.full((5, 5), i))
# td = np.stack(td)

    # a. Slice out the 1st sample into an array x and print it!
    print(td[0])

    # b. Set the 2 lowermost columns of the 10th to -1
    td[9, :, 3:] = -1
    print(td[9])
